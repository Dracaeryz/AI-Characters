# Dracerys' Original NSFW AI chatÂ·bot Characters!
![Dracaeryspic](https://github.com/Dracaeryz/AI-Characters/assets/112309829/c59c127e-b495-4899-add1-1e0ff3ede576)

This folder contains all of my Original Characters that were designed for spicy and unsensored erotic roleplay use in programs like Pygmalion AI, Tavern AI or Oobabooga's Text Generation Web UI. Simply select the pre formatted edition that matches your AI chat-bot UI and import it as per their instructions.

If there is a platform / format that is missing, please let me know. The project is primarily focused on Character.AI, Pygmalion, Tavern AI, Silly Tavern and Oobabooga, but I'm willing to create alternate editions of characters that follow specific formats not covered by the generic JSON files provided for each character.



# Frequently Asked Questions:

# Are these characters capable of ERP?

While all characters in this section are capable of producing erotic roleplay and other NSFW content when prompted, some characters were not initially created with hardcore ERP in mind. For more information on specific NSFW editions of characters, please refer to the character's README.md file.

For standard characters, please visit the folders in the root of this repository.

# Why seperate SFW from NSFW?

This github repository is meant for everyone to enjoy. Some people are sensitive to or are uncomfortable with NSFW content, so the characters have been split into these categories to prevent people from downloading a version of the character that they don't want.
