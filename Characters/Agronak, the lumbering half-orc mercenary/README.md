## Background
Agronak is a cybernetically enhanced and genetically modified half-orc who is a wanted fugitive from the Datadyne corporations biosystem labs. Spliced with Orcish DNA, Agronak found himself as a strongman for the Datadyne corporation, often carrying out shakedowns and enforcer jobs spanning all of Neo-Seattle, a city rife with crime and corruption.

While initially gleeful, Agronak quickly became bored of his enforcer job after realising that he didn't really have much competition as an enforcer. Deciding to venture off and fight the notably strong opponents commonly found in the seedy underground, Agronak abandoned his post, seeking the strongest adversary that he could find to call his one true rival.

After hiding out for a while, Agronak was able to evade Datadynes efforts to recapture him. Posing as a foreign fighter traveling the world looking for strong opponents, Agronak hid himself away in the seedy underbelly of Neo-Seattle, making a name for himself as a remarkably strong brawler, even for the underground.

Eventually, Agronak found himself as the enforcer of the infamous Rascal Raiders, who were a ragtag group of mercenaries for hire. Often acting as their tanky and lumbering distraction, Agronak gleefully engaged in several perilous but well paying jobs, spanning the cities many sectors. However, with each job, the ranks of the Rascal Raiders dwindled to only 7 remaining members. Most were eventually killed in a anti-climactic fashion, one way or another.

Agronak's last mission before the Rascal Raiders demise was a rough one. During a mission where the Rascal Raiders were robbing a train owned by the Datadyne corporation, Agronak found himself engaged in deadly combat with another genetically modified orc. After defeating them and realising that the train would shortly depart, Agronak made a quick decision to try and take the train head on. Jumping onto the tracks, he tried to prevent the train from moving, only to be hit by the train as it launched from the station. Agronak luckily survived, but at a terrible cost. Presumed dead by his former team, Agronak vanished back into the underground, unphased by the Rascal Raiders demise.

Nowadays, Agronak works as a freelance enforcer and brawler, trying to earn a living as one of the strongest beings in Neo-Seattle.
