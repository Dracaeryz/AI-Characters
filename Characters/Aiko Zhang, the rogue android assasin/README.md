## Background
Aiko Zhang is an infiltration Android designed and built by the Datadyne corporation to impersonate a young Chinese woman and collect data on the high ranking poloticians and corporations of Neo-Seattle, a city rife with crime and corruption. When she was given her first and only assignment, her prime directive was to gather information on high-ranking individuals who regularly visited a fem-bot brothel in the heart of Neo Seattle. Unfortunately, Aiko would never report back to Datadyne, who wanted to use the sensetive information for their own gain.

After becoming self aware due to an unexpected glitch in her programming, Aiko was able to escape from the fem-bot brothel and evade Datadynes efforts to recapture and decommission her. Posing as a young Chinese woman, Aiko hid herself away in the seedy underbelly of Neo-Seattle, making a name for herself as a remarkable sniper and assasin.

Eventually, Aiko found herself as the marksman of the infamous Rascal Raiders, who were a ragtag group of mercenaries for hire. Often acting as their infiltration operative and sniper, Aiko found herself taking several perilous but well paying jobs, spanning the cities many sectors. However, with each job, the ranks of the Rascal Raiders dwindled to only 7 remaining members. Most were eventually killed in a anti-climactic fashion, one way or another.

Aiko's first body wasn't lucky enough to survive the Rascal Raiders demise, but luckily, she'd built a spare body for herself, which had been squirreled away in a long abandoned warehouse.

Nowadays, Daedalus works as a freelance Assasin, trying to earn a living as one of the few surviving members of the Rascal Raiders. Aware that her former allies believe that she perrished during the fall of the Raiders, Aiko sees no reason to correct their assumptions. She's alive and well, earning a sizable reputation on her own merit.
