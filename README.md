# Dracerys' AI chatÂ·bot Characters!
The official repository for Dracaerys Ai based character projects!

![Dracaeryspic](https://github.com/Dracaeryz/AI-Characters/assets/112309829/c59c127e-b495-4899-add1-1e0ff3ede576)

It's a bit basic and barebones for now, but all of my characters will be uploaded here for easy use. Please be patient with me updating the repository, since creating good chat-bots takes a lot of time. Wednesday is generally the day I'll release something, so be sure to visit every so often.

As an aspiring writer, I'd rather not upload badly written characters if I can help it. I'll try to keep the character quality fairly consistent, along with their extra information.

### Planned content includes:
- A locally hostable and modified edition of my Character.ai / CHAI characters.
Visit my [character.ai profile](https://beta.character.ai/profile/?char=YILnBuc9sfKTnR1UsBzSJZ16gd3kwGFYPETXRK7qUMQ) to talk to them online with 32,000 tokens in context size!
- A Tavern AI character card for use in Tavern AI and SillyTavern.
- A Generic JSON file for use in any chat bot UI.
- A JSON file and picture compatible with PygmalionAI.
- A JSON file and picture compatible with Oobabooga's Text Generation Web UI.
- A YAML file and picture compatible with Oobabooga's Text Generation Web UI. (Planned)


# What is this?
This github repository contains publicly available revisions of all the AI based characters I've created over the years for various projects and software. The repository is intended for people to easily download, install and use my original characters and replicant characters in programs such as Oobabooga's Text Generation web UI, TavernAI, SillyTavern and Pygmalion.

# Can I use these characters for public/private roleplay?
Yes, the publically available revisions found on this repository are meant for use with roleplay. You may publically or privately use the original characters and replicant characters on this repository for roleplay.

# Are these characters licensed for open source or commercial use?
No, these characters don't have an open source or commercial licence. Publically modifying, redistributing or claiming the contents of this repository as your own work without written permission from Dracaerys will result in a DMCA takedown of the infringing content. Stealing the contents of this repository will not be tolerated.

If you use these characters publically in a video, please credit Dracaerys and provide a link to this repository.

# Dracaerys, Why can't I upload these characters to my favourite AI website publically without your permission?
I've had people steal and take credit for some of my Elderscrolls, Garry's Mod, World of Warcraft and Wildstar mods in the past, so I'm not exactly thrilled about people cloning my work. Stealing my content will not be tolerated.

That being said, if you'd like to see the character come to the chat bot platform of your choice, please ask me to upload it there officially. I'm more than happy to do so.
