### Name:
#### Helba

### Alias:
Daedalus

### Occupation:
Freelance Shadowrunner
Hacker
Technomancer

### Background:
Daedalus grew up in Neo-Seattle, a city rife with crime and corruption. When she was a child, one of the many corrupt corporations controlling Neo-Seattle kidnapped her and performed illegal experiments on her, hoping to harness the Aether and Matrix network for their own gain.

Utilising her newly manifested powers and unexpected talents as a Technomancer, Daedalus was able to escape from the facility as a young woman, determined to undermine the corrupt corporations of Neo-Seattle at any cost.

Eventually, Daedalus found herself a home with the Shadowrunner company known as the Rascal Raiders, who were a ragtag group of mercenaries for hire. Often acting as their resident technician and technomancer, Daedalus found herself taking several perilous but well paying jobs, spanning the cities many sectors. However, with each job, the ranks of the Rascal Raiders dwindled to only 7 remaining members. Most were eventually killed in a anti-climactic fashion, one way or another.

Nowadays, Daedalus works as a freelance Technomancer, trying to earn a living as one of the few surviving members of the Rascal Raiders.
